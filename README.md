# Project Euler solutions

My take on Project Euler problems. First doing the 50 first problems with plain ES6 JavaScript, but might do other languages later. Also this is a test bench where I try and use various Git procedures and other programming related techniques.

## JavaScript

Uses *Node v10.15.3*

All JS files are `.mjs` files, so they can use ES6 style importing and exporting and several other ES6 style JS syntax directly.
To run the `.mjs` scripts use `node --experimental-modules <name>.mjs`
